## Phase v0.1: Exploring how to create Pete

**Progress:** `[░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 0.1%`

I'm building an AI assistant that runs **entirely on your iPhone**. No cloud, no internet required. Just you and Pete.

**The vision:** An assistant that learns your patterns, anticipates what you need, and is ready when you need it — without you asking.

**Currently experimenting with:**
- On-device LLM integration
- Pattern recognition and context awareness
- Proactive assistance architecture

**Why?** Just for fun.

*Status: Early exploration. Expect nothing, hope for something cool.*
